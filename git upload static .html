<h1>SPORTS CARS</h1><br/>
A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, or thrill of driving. <br/>
Sports cars originated in Europe in the early 1900s and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.<p/>
<br/>
<h2>SOME CLASSIC DEF's</h2><br/>
The classic definition of a sports car is a small vehicle with two doors that is made for no other purpose than quick performance and masterful handling. <br/>
The truth, however, is that there are as many different definitions for "sports car" as there are sports car drivers.<br/>
A sports car can be an everyday car or a racing vehicle. Although a 6-cylinder engine or 12-cylinder engine -- or even an 4-cylinder -- can be used, <br/>
you want to buy a sports car with a V8 engine if you want a lot of power and torque when you accelerate.<br/>
 This kind of engine has eight cylinders in the crankcase and often smoother than a V6 engine -- and the exhaust note is often sweeter.<br/> 
 A V8 is significantly cheaper to buy than a V12 engine as well. US car brands, such as Ford and Chevrolet,<br/>
 offer V8 engines in many of their sports cars that allow drivers to feel the power of a racecar during their everyday commute.<br/><p/>
